# cldr-json

This repository provides the JSON distribution of [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) locale data for internationalization

It should be noted that XML (not JSON) is the "official" format for all CLDR data.  The
JSON data contained herein is provided as a convenience for the development community, and
is programatically generated from the corresponding XML, using the JSON conversion utility
that is provided as part of the CLDR tooling (written in Java).

The data in these packages is intended to serve as a common reference point for most
JavaScript packages. As such, this JSON data is generated using only data that has achieved
draft="contributed" or draft="approved" status in the CLDR. This is the same threshhold
as is used by the [ICU](http://icu-project.org) (International Components for Unicode).

If you require JSON data containing provisional or unconfirmed data, you can generate it
using the Ldml2JSON conversion utility in CLDR's tools distribution (`org.unicode.cldr.json`).

## Package Organization

Because the CLDR is so large and contains so many different types of information, the JSON data
here is grouped into packages by functionality. For each type of functionality, there are two
available packages: The "[modern][]" packages, which contain the set of locales listed as modern
coverage targets by the CLDR subcomittee, and the "[full][]" packages, which contain the rest of
the locales not in the modern coverage listing. The functional packages are:

 - **[cldr-core][]**    : Basic CLDR supplemental data â€” only one package here, no "full" and "modern".
 - **cldr-dates**       : Data for date/time formatting, including data for Gregorian calendar.
                          Requires that the corresponding "numbers" package be installed as well.
 - **cldr-cal-[type]**  : CLDR data for non-Gregorian calendars. [type] is one of the supported
                          non-Gregorian calendar types in CLDR: ( buddhist, chinese, coptic, dangi,
                          hebrew, indian, islamic, japanese, persian, roc ).
 - **cldr-localenames** : Translated versions of locale display name elements: languages, scripts,
                          territories, variants.
 - **cldr-misc**        : Other CLDR data not defined elsewhere.
 - **cldr-numbers**     : Data for number formatting.
 - **cldr-segments**    : Line breaking data from Unicode's ULI project ( http://uli.unicode.org/ )
 - **cldr-units**       : Data for units formatting.
